# VelesTools Community Source License v1.0

This license governs the source code of the Veles Tools project (the "Software").  
By accessing, downloading, forking, or contributing to the Software, you agree to the terms below.  
If you do not agree, do not use the Software.

> **Note:** This is a *source-available* license, **not** an open-source license as defined by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).

---

## 1. Purpose

The Software is shared so the community can review how it works, suggest improvements, and contribute code.  
You may run it for your own **personal use**, but the code is **not** released for unrestricted commercial
redistribution or for forks that remove built-in licensing or payment logic.

“Personal use” means use by an individual for their own use, research, or education purposes, and does not include
internal business or commercial operations of an organization.

## 2. Granted Permissions

You may:

1. Read and analyze the source code for education, code review, or security research.
2. Fork the repository and run the Software for local development, testing, or preparing contributions back to this
   project.
3. Use the official binaries or an unmodified local build for your personal use or research so long as you do not
   disable or modify licensing, billing, telemetry, or access-control logic.
4. Submit issues, pull requests, and other contributions under the terms of this license.

You may **not** upload modified versions of the Software or its derivatives to the Chrome Web Store or any similar
platform, share it or sell it without prior written permission from the copyright holder.

## 3. Prohibited Uses

Unless you receive prior written permission from the copyright holder, you may **not**:

1. Offer the Software (or any derivative) as a hosted service, SaaS, downloadable product, or tool to third parties,
   whether free or paid.
2. Modify, remove, bypass, or interfere with any paywall, licensing, billing, telemetry, or access-control logic
   introduced by the project author, including when such features are added in the future.
3. Publish or distribute a fork that replicates the core functionality and competes with the official monetized version,
   whether by offering it for free or at a different price.
4. Ship a derivative that causes or is likely to cause financial harm to the project maintainer, including but not
   limited to disabling purchase requirements or redirecting payments away from official channels.
5. Circumvent or attempt to circumvent any technical measures designed to enforce licensing, billing, or access
   restrictions.
6. Sublicense, sell, rent, or redistribute the Software or any derivative.
7. Remove or alter copyright notices or represent the Software as your own work.

Any use outside the permissions listed in Section&nbsp;2 automatically violates this license.

1. Represent that you have the right to do so and that your contribution is original.
2. License your contribution to the project under this same license.
3. Acknowledge that the project maintainer may relicense future versions of the Software.
4. Agree that your contributions may be used in commercial versions or services derived from the Software.

## 5. Warranty and Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
